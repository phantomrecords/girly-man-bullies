    <h1>Girly-Man-Bullies</h1>
    <p>This site is a record of manipulative bullying by men who act kind-hearted on the surface while gaslighting their targets and planting false narratives.</p>
    <p>These individuals use charm as a weapon, building trust with bystanders while secretly attempting to provoke violence or reactions from their victims. Their ultimate goal is often to bait the target into a "first-strike" â€” framing them as the aggressor to escalate the situation into legal consequences.</p>
    <p>We document these tactics to shed light on this form of psychological abuse and provide validation for those who have been mischaracterized or wrongly punished due to such manipulation.</p>
