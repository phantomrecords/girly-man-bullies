# Girly-Man-Bullies

This repository documents personal experiences and public behavior patterns of men who exhibit manipulative and covertly aggressive behaviors, posing as kind-hearted individuals while orchestrating campaigns of emotional and physical harm. These "girly-man bullies" often engage in gaslighting, false narrative planting, and provocation strategies designed to trick their targets into retaliating â€” triggering legal or reputational consequences for the victim.

The goal is to expose, understand, and document these harmful behaviors to prevent further abuse and provide educational and legal insight into this destructive psychological pattern.
